Configure Boost
===============

As a prerequisite to use Boost, you need to register Boost an a Mastodon app on the instance hosting your Mastodon account.

In order to configure Boost, you need to create a boost.ini file (or any name you prefer, finishing with the extension .ini) with the following parameters::

    [mastodon]
    users_to_boost=someone@mastodon.social,someonelse@framapiarg.org
    instance_url=https://mastodon.social
    user_credentials=boost_usercred.txt
    client_credentials=boost_clientcred.txt

    [boost]
    boosts = 0
    do_not_boost_hashtags=dnr,
    only_if_hashtags=python,
    match=[Rr]egex
    ; only boost toots older than n minutes
    older_than=60
    ; only boost toots younger than n minutes
    younger_than=120
    favorite=true

    [sqlite]
    sqlite_path=/var/lib/boost/boost.db
